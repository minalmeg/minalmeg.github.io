Ask me about machine learning, Rage Against the Machine Learning, and my protein intake.

Currently, Engineer [@Kawa Space](https://www.kawa.space/). 

Before Kawa Space
------

Tried my at hand at founding team stuff [@Rove Health](https://www.rovehealth.co/about-1) and it wasn't tea of my cup (iykyk). Survived a semester at CMU INI, where my lines of code outnumbered my daily steps, which wasn't a lot to begin with. There, I worked with CMU's [Catalyst group](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/) focused on MLSys under Prof. Zhihao Jia. Before CMU, I was working as a Research Engineer at [REConnect Energy](https://www.reconnectenergy.com/) where I designed and developed time-series forecasting solutions. I was also an AI Engineer at [Cynapto Technologies](https://www.cynapto.com/) and worked on optimising ML pipelines on edge devices. 

When I'm not working, I play badminton or go to the gym or obsess over my protein intake.
