Survived a semester at CMU INI, where acronyms outnumbered common sense. There, I worked with CMU's [Catalyst group](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/) focused on MLSys under Prof. Zhihao Jia. Before CMU, I was working as a Research Engineer at [REConnect Energy](https://www.reconnectenergy.com/) where I designed and developed time-series forecasting solutions. I was also an AI Engineer at [Cynapto Technologies](https://www.cynapto.com/) and worked on optimising ML pipelines on edge devices.
